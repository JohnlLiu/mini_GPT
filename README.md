This project creates a chatbot that behaves similarily to ChatGPT! Enter a prompt, and it will give you a response! 

The transformer model is built completely from scratch and is trained on the Tiny Shakespeare Dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt

A detailed breakdown on how the project is developed and deployed can be found in my Medium articles:
